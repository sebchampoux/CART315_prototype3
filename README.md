# CART315 Prototype 3

Design journal in the wiki.

## Playtesting the game

The scene to open is `Assets/Scenes/Menu.unity`.  `AnotherScene.unity` will also work, but you'll miss the menu and instructions.  Don't open `Main.unity`, it doesn't work, it is a leftover from the original game.

The goal of the game, if you don't understand french, is to catch eggs on the farm and bring them back to the pickup truck, without getting caught by the enemies that are roaming around.

All the text is in french, because the text is embedded in images for which I do not have the Photoshop files.  If I go forward with this prototype I'll find a way to translate the text.
